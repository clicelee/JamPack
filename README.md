JamPack is a macOS application that allows you to combine multiple code files into a single text file easily.  
Originally designed to overcome GPT's 10-file reading limitation, it packages multiple files together for convenient AI input or archival.

## Features
- Drag & Drop multiple code files
- See custom icons for each programming language
- Reorder files by dragging
- Remove uploaded files individually
- Merge selected files into a single `.txt` file
- Automatically names the merged file based on the selected files
- Protects against uploading unsupported file types (e.g., images, binaries)

## Supported Languages
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Swift, Java, PHP, Ruby, Rust, C, C++, C#, Go, Kotlin, Lua, SQL, Perl, Scala, Sass, Vue, and more.

## Installation
1. Download [`JamPack.dmg`](https://github.com/clicelee/JamPack/releases/tag/v1.0.0)
2. Open the `.dmg` file
3. Drag the **JamPack** icon into the **Applications** folder
4. Launch **JamPack** from your Applications

## Requirements
- macOS 12.0 or later (Monterey+)

## Why JamPack?
GPT-based models often limit the number of files they can process simultaneously.  
JamPack helps you **merge files together safely** while preserving the file names and structure, allowing AI systems to better understand your project!
